# Cross-Language Interaction Sandbox

Various experiments with programming languages and platforms. All projects was tested on mac.

## Examples of cross-language polymorphism using C# and C++
* `CSharp-Cpp-CppSharp`
* `CSharp-Cpp-Interop`
* `CSharp-Cpp-SWIG`

## Example in multiplatform environment
* `Cpp-Cross-Platform` - example of using C++ with C# on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.

## Commentary
`CppLibraryProject` is copy-pasted and slightly modified across the projects, to make it obvious which differences each approach has.
