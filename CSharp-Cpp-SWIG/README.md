# C# & C++ SWIG Example

Same thing as [CSharp-Cpp-InteropExample](https://github.com/m039/CSharpCppInteropExample), but using [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) to generate wrappers.

* `CppLibraryProject` is a core library.
* `SwigLibraryProject` is a wrapper for the core library.
* `CSharpConsoleProject` is an example how to use the core library.
* `Precompiled` is a folder with a shared library.
